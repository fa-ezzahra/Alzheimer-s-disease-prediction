# Alzheimer's Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting Alzheimer's disease using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can identify the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease based on various features, enabling early detection and facilitating timely medical interventions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
- **Model Building:** Multiple machine learning algorithms to evaluate performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessing models using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains features related to Alzheimer's disease, such as demographic information, clinical tests, and other relevant indicators. Ensure the dataset is properly preprocessed before running the models.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alzheimers-disease-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd alzheimers-disease-prediction
   ```



## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Alzheimers_disease.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Results
The project provides insights into:
- The most important features contributing to Alzheimer's prediction.
- Model performance comparison.
- Recommendations for improving prediction accuracy.
